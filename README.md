# Description
This is the Cat Clicker project from the **Frontend
Applications** section of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree course.

## Instructions
All JavaScript is written with ES6 code and uses the latest features
available to my Google Chrome browser. No build tools were used to
transpile the code so ensure you're running a recent version of your
browser.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork, tweak and submit pull requests - I will be happy
to review and accept any PRs.
