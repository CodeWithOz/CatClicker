# Description
This repository contains different projects from the **Frontend
Applications** section of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree course.

## Instructions
All projects will be written with ES6 code and use the latest features
available to my Google Chrome browser. For some projects, I will use
build tools to perform any necessary transpiling. If necessary, I will
include a README.md with instructions for specific projects.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork, tweak and submit pull requests - I will be happy
to review and accept any PRs.
